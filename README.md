# SQL Work Sample
## Overview
Welcome to my SQL work sample repository. Here, you'll find a curated collection of SQL queries that I developed while serving as a Research Analyst at BC Stats. In this role, I engaged extensively with survey data to uncover insights into participant engagement and survey effectiveness, while also leading efforts in data quality assurance.

## What's Inside
The queries in this repository highlight my comprehensive SQL skills, including but not limited to:

* Dynamic SQL: Crafting flexible queries that adapt to varying data structures and requirements, allowing for automated analysis across different survey iterations.
* Window Functions: Utilizing advanced SQL features, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to perform sophisticated data analysis tasks.
* Data Aggregation and Analysis: Employing GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG to extract meaningful statistics and insights.
* Data Cleaning Techniques: Implementing CASE statements, NULLIF, and conditional logic to refine and prepare datasets for analysis or reporting.
* Complex Joins: Merging data from multiple sources using various join operations, demonstrating an understanding of relational database principles.

## Goal
The primary aim of this repository is to illustrate my analytical prowess and SQL proficiency in addressing real-world data challenges. Through these samples, I aim to underscore my capability to come up with clean, precise, and actionable data insights.
